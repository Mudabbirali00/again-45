// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.



let magicians1 : string[] =["david", "harry", "potter"]
function show_magicians2(magicians: string[]):void{
    magicians.forEach(names =>{
        console.log(`${names}`)
    })
}


function make_great1(magicians1 : string[]):void{
    for(let i = 0; i < magicians1.length; i++ ){
        magicians1[i] = "The Great " + magicians1[i]
    }
}

make_great(magicians1)

show_magicians1(magicians1)
