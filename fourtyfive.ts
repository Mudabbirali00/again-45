// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

type car = {
    manufacturer : string;
    model: string;
    [key : string]:any
}


function carDetails(manufacturer: string, model: string, options: Partial<car>):car{
    return {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model :model,
        ...options
    }
}
    
let info = carDetails("Honda", "Civic",{color : "black", year : 2022})
