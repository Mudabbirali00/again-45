// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

// let car = 'subaru';

// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

// console.log(car == 'subaru')

// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.

// test #1
let iceCream = "chocolate"
console.log("Is IceCream == 'chocolate' is available? I predict True")
console.log(iceCream == "chocolate")

// test #2

let motorBike = "Honda"
console.log("Is motorBike == 'Honda' is available? i predict true")
console.log(motorBike == "Honda")

// test #3
let passenger = "bus"
console.log("Is passenger == in 'bus' is less than 20? i predict true")
console.log(passenger == "bus")

// test #4
let pasLimit = 180
console.log("Is pasLimit == is greater than '180'? i predict true")
console.log(pasLimit > 170)

// test #5
let buns = 8
console.log("Is buns == in shop less than 10? I predict true")
console.log(buns < 10)
let thenHowMuch = buns
console.log(thenHowMuch)

// test #6
let number = 13
console.log("Is number == '13' is greater than or equal to 12? i predict false ")
console.log(number == 12)

// test #7
let cows = "available "  
console.log("Is cows == is 'available' in farm? i predict false")
console.log(cows == "notAvailable")

// test #8
let outfit = "adidas"
console.log("Is outfit == 'adidas' is not available? I predict false")
console.log(outfit == "available")

// test #9 
let cars = 17
console.log("Is cars == is greater than 17? I predict false")
console.log(cars > 17)

// test #10
let chickens = 5
console.log("Is chickens == is more than 5 available in your shop ")
console.log(chickens > 5)
